HARDWARE:
- green leds La Lb
- red led Lc
- button B
- potentiometer Pot
- servo-motor M
- sonar S
- pir P (proximity sensor)
- light sensor LS
- LCD


SMART LIGHTING SYSTEM:
P, LS, La
- P detects someone: La turned on or not depending on light level measured by LS
- if level < THl (light threshold): La turned on, otherwise not
- light turned off after T1 if nobody detected or if light level > THl

WATER MONITORING:
S, M, Pot, Lb, Lc, B, LCD
S measures water level continuously
M controls valves: 0째 = closed, 180째 = opened
NORMAL SITUATION: water level < WL1
- Lb on, Lc off, bridge can be used
- water measure every period PEnormal
PRE-ALARM SITUATION: WL1 < water level < WL2
- Lc blinking every 2s
- water measure every PEprealarm < PEnormal
- LCD turned on, informing about pre alarm situation and current water level
ALARM SITUATION: WL2 < water level < WLmax
- smart lighting system turned off (La must be off)
- Lb turned off and Lc on (without blinking)
- water measure every PEalarm < PEprealarm
- valves opened of ALPHA degrees (0째 < ALPHA < 180째), value depends on current water level (0 = WL2, 180 = WLmax)
- valves opening changes dynamically depending on water level
- LCD still on informing about alarm situation, current water level and valves opening degrees
- human can take control by pressing B, then use Pot to control valves opening, then press again B to stop manual control


BASIC VERSION:
report current state (smart lights on/off, alarm situation) of the bridge with a GUI or text based output

COMPLETE VERSION:
graph reporting temporal trend of water level
